     Work and Results Table

Table is populated using metadata where available. Missing
entries will need to be added. Click in a cell to edit it, 
or use "Fill" to duplicate it down the selected column.

The processing will apply an energy calibration, if supplied
and then fit each spectrum using the current fit setup.
Before processing, load a suitable fit-setup. See the
"Fit Results" window for results. 

See the table for a value for "Chi Squared" and "RMS error"
to gauge the quality of the fit (values of RMS Error better
than 10% are typical of good fits).
