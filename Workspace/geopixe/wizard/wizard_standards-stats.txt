     Image Statistics Table

Table of basic image statistics for each data-set. These 
are calculated after normalization to determine "conv". 
These include:

Mean: Average region concentration (ppm), which should 
     now equal the nominal value for the standard.

Error: The 1-sigma error estimate for "Mean" over region.

Std.Dev: The standard deviation (ppm) of the per pixel 
     concentration values over the region.

SD/Error: The ratio of the per pixel standard deviation to
     that expected from Poisson statistics.

A value of "SD/Error" that departs significantly from unity
indicates unwanted structure in the image beyond simple
counting statistics. This may indicate damage, a hole,
contamination or misalignment of the scan (e.g. so it hits 
the sample frame).

     Results File

The results and statistics are exported to a file
called "wizard-standards-results.csv" in the designated
output directory, in comma-separated format.
