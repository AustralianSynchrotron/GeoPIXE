     Calibration Results Plots

Results for "conv" plotted against blog run number
or major line energy. Each beam energy is plotted 
as a separate curve in a different colour.

     Run # order tab

Plots "conv" againt run number.

     Line energy tab

Plots "conv" againt major line energy for element.

     Detector comparisons

To test the effect of changing detector, use the 
droplists to select the old (or existing) detector, 
as used in all yield calculations and DA matrices, 
and a new detector file. 

The plots show the effect of the new detector, but
the table does not. To actually use this new detector 
calibration, you will need to redo the yield 
calculations and DA matrices.

     Results File

The results and statistics are exported to a file
called "wizard-standards-results.csv" in the 
designated output directory, in comma-separated format.
