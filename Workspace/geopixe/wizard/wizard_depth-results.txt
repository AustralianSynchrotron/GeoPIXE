This page shows the results table, with depths determined from the 
page 4.

The table shows the total peak area for all detectors in "Outer"
detectors as "O Area" and its simple statistical uncertainty as
"O error". Similarly, "Inner" area is "I area". The ratio of "Outer/
Inner" and its uncertainty are shown as "Ratio" and "eRatio".

Depth is determined from a spline interpolation on the Ratio versus
Depth curve from the "Depth Curve" file on page 1. 

For now, the uncertainty in depth only includes the effect of statistical
error in the areas, and does not include the effect of errors in the
composition of the first layer in the yield model, which may be much
larger. Try making small changes to composition in the yield calculation
and re-do the depth determination to see the effects of these changes
on depth.
