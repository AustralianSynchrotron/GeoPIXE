     Import Spectra and Fit Wizard

The Wizard will search for all spectra data files of the
type selected in the selected 'data' directory. 

Each will be imported and then fitted using the current
fit set-up details. A new energy calibration will be
applied if a file is selected.

Results are stored in the Table on tab two, which includes
Chi-Squared and RMS error estimates for the fit.

     Controls

Scan Data Dir: Scan raw data dir for data files and populate
     the table based on metadata.
