This page is used to form separate SPEC files for use to provide both energy 
calibration and also to enable "Outer" or "Inner" detector channels when 
using image sorting later in "Sort EVT". These images will be used to 
construct RGB images with depth contrast on page 3.

Cal SPEC files for Outer and Inner detectors:

If you need to build separate E Cal SPEC files for the "Outer" and "Inner"
detectors, then use the top panel, starting with a Cal SPEC file for all
detector channels. 

Select .select.csv files for the "Outer" and "Inner" detectors, if these are 
not already set from the previous page, or click on "Set" to define these 
select files.

Click on "Form Outer, Inner Cals" to build E Cal files for just Outer and 
Inner channels. These will be saved to files, as shown in the bottom panel.

Load existing Cal SPEC files for Outer and Inner:

If you already have these SPEC files, then fill in the bottom panel only to 
progress the procedure to the "RGB" page, else fill in the top panel, and 
then click "Form Outer,Inner Cals" to create them.
