Some notes on Linux

1. Once geopixe is installed on your Linux system, add the path to 
   geopixe/bin to your session PATH. All scripts for running GeoPIXE
   programs are located here. Do not use soft links to the scripts
   in this directory.

2. GeoPIXE now recognizes the following file-names for libraries:

	image_lib.32bit.so		32 bit library
	image_lib.64bit.so		64 bit library

   These library file are supplied and can be found on the FTP site too.
   GeoPIXE will select the library appropriate for your system.

3. GeoPIXE now uses the directory ".geopixe" in your Home directory for
   the following

   geopixe.conf          config file, e.g. set-up default initial paths
                         will default to reading this file from geopixe dir.

   file-requester.paths  path bookmarks file
                         will default to reading this file from geopixe dir.

   geopixe-update.conf   config file for FTP update client.
   ftp-update.ignore     file specifications (w/ wildcards ?,*) to 
                         protect during FTP update.

   *__log.txt   parallel processing log files

   * Templates for the .conf files are located in the geopixe directory and
     copied to users .geopixe directory when first used.
