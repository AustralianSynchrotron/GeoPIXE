# Contributing to GeoPIXE Open Source

Historically, GeoPIXE has endeavoured to cater for the needs of many laboratories and users in the ion beam, synchrotron
 science and laboratory source spaces. Hence, the main interface and GUI controls are more general purpose, with many very specific needs 
maintained in plugins, e.g. for image and spectrum processing, or device objects, which handle specific data import
features, which can be very specific to a particular laboratory or beam-line. Feature requests have been handled through
an email to "geopixe@csiro.au".

For the time being, the open source version will continue in the same vein, while we develop guidelines and further documentation
to focus changes to the best part of GeoPIXE for all users. In time, this should evolve to more user involvement as
more people develop an effective overview of the software as a whole and the philosophy of (i) maintaining backward
compatibility with all previously generated data files, and across all supported and historical computer platforms, 
and (ii) maintaining the general purpose core, while supporting specific needs in plugins (image processing, spectrum processing,
background algorithms, Wizards and GUI extensions) and device objects.
